`FastMemory` is a simple and convenient class for working with in-memory data, which allows you to save and load data to and from a file. It supports automatic memory clearing and an intuitive interface.

## Installation

First, ensure you have Python installed. Then create a file named `fast_memory.py` and paste the code of the `FastMemory` class into it.

## Importing the Class

It is recommended to import the class using an alias for easier use:

```python
from fast_memory import FastMemory as fm
```

This allows you to use `fm` instead of the full name `FastMemory`, making your code more convenient and readable.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `FastMemory` class:

```python
# example.py

from fast_memory import FastMemory as fm

# Creating a new FastMemory instance
folder_path = 'C:/Users/nevil/OneDrive/Desktop/Fast memory'
file_name = 'data.fm'

# Use the new method to create an instance
with fm.new(folder_path, file_name).auto_clear() as memory:
    # Setting values
    memory.set('name', 'Alice')
    memory.set('age', '30')

    # Getting values
    print(memory.get('name'))  # Output: Alice
    print(memory.get('age'))   # Output: 30

    # Checking for the existence of a key
    print(memory.exists('age'))  # Output: True
    print(memory.exists('gender'))  # Output: False

    # Getting all keys
    print(memory.keys())  # Output: ['name', 'age']

# Memory is automatically cleared here
print(memory.keys())  # Output: []
```

## Class Methods

- **`new(folder_path, file_name)`**: Creates a new instance of `FastMemory` with the specified folder path and filename. The file will be automatically created if it does not exist.
  
- **`set(key, value)`**: Sets a value for the specified key.

- **`get(key)`**: Returns the value for the specified key.

- **`delete(key)`**: Deletes the value for the specified key.

- **`exists(key)`**: Checks whether the specified key exists.

- **`keys()`**: Returns a list of all keys.

- **`clear()`**: Clears all data.

- **`auto_clear()`**: Context manager for automatically clearing memory upon exiting the `with` block.

## Automatic Memory Clearing

By using the `auto_clear()` method, you can ensure that your data will be cleared after you are done working with it, helping to prevent memory overflow and protecting sensitive information.
